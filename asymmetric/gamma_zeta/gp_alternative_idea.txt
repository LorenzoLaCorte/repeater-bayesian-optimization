    This function generates a protocol from the center, spacing and symmetricity parameters.
    
    Parameters:
    - zeta: Centering of the ro. of distillation, between -1 and 1.
    - tau: Spacing of the ro. of distillation, between 0 and 1.
    - gamma: Symmetricity of the protocol, between 0 and 1.
    
    Returns:
    - tuple: the protocol to be tested.

    I. Sample of the sequence of swaps
    II. Sample of the sequences of distillations, before and after each swap

    The protocol is generated as follows:
        I. The set of all the possible sequences of swaps is generated.
        They are ordered by the symmetricity of the shape of the swaps, from the least symmetric to the most symmetric.
        The (gamma*len(swap_space)) sequence is selected;
            if gamma = 0, the least symmetric sequence is selected;
            if gamma = 1, the most symmetric sequence is selected.

        II. For the selected sequence of swaps, the set of all the possible sequences of distillations is generated.
            seq = (D_0, swap_0, D_1, swap_1, D_2, ..., D_S, swap_S-1, D_S)
            where D_0, D_1, ..., D_S are the sequences of distillations.
        Factors gamma_i, between 0 and 1, are given to each D_i, to model the sampling of the sequences.
        They are sampled from a normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation gamma.
            where mu is derived from the centering and gamma from the spacing.
            if zeta = 0, gamma_0 = 1;
            if zeta = 1, gamma_S = 1;
        Given Di, the sequence of distillations is picked from the set of all the possible ones,
            with a probability proportional to gamma_i.
            if gamma_i = 0, the first sequence of distillations, corresponding to no distillation, is picked.
            if gamma_i = 1, the last sequence of distillations, corresponding to the maximum number of distillations, is picked.
