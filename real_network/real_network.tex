\section*{Notation}

We represent a protocol as a tuple of swaps and distillations, for example:
\begin{equation*}
    (d0, s0, d1, s2, s1)
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the first letter represents the protocol to be performed: \(d\) for distillation and \(s\) for swap,
    \item the number represents the segment to be distilled or, in the case of a swap, the segment to be swapped with the adjacent right one.
\end{itemize}

When two links are swapped, the joined segment is represented by the right segment index.

In the example above, the protocol is composed of 3 distillations and 2 swaps, and it is performed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item d0: distillation of segment 0,
    \item s0: swap of segments 0 and 1,
    \item d1: distillation of the joined segment of 0 and 1 (now represented as segment 1),
    \item s2: swap of segments 2 and 3,
    \item s1: final swap between the two joined segments 0-1 and 2-3.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Considering a protocol with $N$ nodes and $S=N-1$ segments, restrictions implied by this notation are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item a protocol must perform exactly $S$ entanglement swapping operations,
  \item $d\{i\}$ is allowed only if $s\{i\}$ has not been performed yet, otherwise the protocol is invalid.
\end{enumerate}

For example, $(d0, s0, \textcolor{red}{d0}, s2, s1)$ is not valid, as the joined segment 0-1 is represented by $s1$ after entanglement swapping has been performed to join the two segments, and so $\textcolor{red}{d0}$ does not have any meaning.

\section*{Size of the Protocol Space}

The size of the protocol space is given by the number of possible sequences of swaps and distillations, considering the restrictions imposed by the notation. The number of valid possible sequences of swaps is given by the number of Catalan numbers of $N-2$.
\\\\
When considering distillations, we define $\kappa$ as the maximum number of distillations allowed by a segment ${{i}}$, and we iterate over all possible values of $\kappa$ from 0 to a maximum number of distillations per segment $\beta$.
\footnotetext[1]{From numerical results, I just searched the series here \url{https://oeis.org/search?q=1,5,40,385&language=english&go=Search}.}
Thus, considering $N$ nodes, $S$ segments, and $\kappa$ distillations per segment, the number of possible repeater protocols is given by the Generalized Catalan number \footnotemark[1] of order $S$ and parameter $\kappa+1$, over all $\kappa$ from 0 to $\beta$:
\begin{equation}
    |P| = \sum_{\kappa=0}^{\beta} C(S, \kappa+1) ,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
    C(n,k)= \binom{(k+1)*n-2}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{(k*n-1)} .
\end{equation}

\section*{Methodology}

\subsection*{Encoding for Bayesian optimization}

We encode a protocol by starting from two real values $\gamma$ and $\zeta$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\gamma\) represents the symmetricity of the protocol,
    \item \(\zeta\): represents the centering of the rounds of distillation,
\end{itemize}
they are both arbitrary real values between $0$ and $1$.
\\\\
Considering a protocol with $N=2^n+1$ for an integer $n$, the most symmetric protocol (yielded by \(\gamma=1\)), corresponds to the protocol which can be run by Boxi Li machinery.
For example, for $N=5$, the most symmetric protocol $(s0, s2, s1)$ corresponds to the protocol $(0,0)$.
All the non-symmetric protocols considered cannot be represented in the Boxi Li machinery.
\\\\
The encoding returns a tuple which represents the sequence of swaps and rounds of distillation to be performed.
\\\\
The protocol is generated as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The set of all possible sequences of swaps $P_{swap}$ is generated. 
    They are ordered by the symmetricity of the shape of the swaps, from the least symmetric to the most symmetric. The \((\gamma \times |P_{swap}|\)) sequence is selected, so that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if \(\gamma = 0\), the least symmetric sequence is selected,
        \item if \(\gamma = 1\), the most symmetric sequence is selected.
    \end{itemize}
    \item For the selected sequence of swaps, the set of all possible sequences of distillations is generated:
    \[
    \text{seq} = (D_0, \text{swap}_0, D_1, \text{swap}_1, D_2, \ldots, D_S, \text{swap}_{S-1}, D_S)
    \]
    where \(D_0, D_1, \ldots, D_S\) are the sequences of distillations. 
    A sequence $D_i$ is generated by considering the swaps performed so far, can include from $0$ to up to a maximum rounds of distillation per segment per level.
    We consider all the possible joined sequences of swaps and distillations $P_{joined}$, ordered from the lowest to the highest  number of rounds of distillations performed. 
    The \((\zeta \times |P_{joined}|)\) sequence is selected, such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if \(\zeta = 0\), the sequence with no rounds of distillation is selected.
        \item if \(\zeta = 1\), the sequence with the maximum number of rounds of distillation is selected.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
